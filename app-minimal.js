// Minimal app.js for transition period - contains only property panel logic
// This will be removed once all nodes are extracted

// Legacy property panel code - TODO: Replace with PropertyPanel module
// For now, just include the showNodeProperties function as a compatibility bridge

// This file serves as a compatibility layer during the refactoring process
